# Unit 2: Scarne's Dice

This project is developed as a part of [Applied CS with Android](https://cswithandroid.withgoogle.com/) course. 

### Rules of the game

* In a chance, a player can roll dice as many times as they wish as long as they don't get a 1.
* If they get a 1, all points they earn in that chance is reverted and the turn goes to the opposite player.
* A player can also HOLD in his chance means transferring the chance to the opposite user without making a die roll.
* The first player who reaches the score of 100 wins.


### Extensions

#### Added game activity logging feature
