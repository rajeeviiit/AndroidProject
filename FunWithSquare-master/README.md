This is Android Fun game to add digit and make a perfect Square Number and perfect cube and perfect fourth root  for a  Given prefix number.
 
* Rules of the Game:<br/>
    (Fun_Math)^2 is a simple math game where user need to guess the correct length perfect<br/>
    square,cube ,fourth root for a  given prefix. The prefix is n-1, where n is the actual<br/>
    length of the perfect square ,cube and fourth root.<br/>
    1.First you need to select the level like square ,cube and fourth root.</br>
 There are basically three rounds for each level:<br/>
   * First Round:<br/>
     User need to guess 5 different perfect squares of length 3 given a prefix of 2.<br/>
     If user is able to guess the correct square then he wins and a message pops out,you win press next to continue<br/>
     If he fails to guess then he loose and a message pops out,you loose press next to continue <br/>
     For each correct answer you will get +5 and for wrong answer -2 score will deduct.</br>

  * Second Round:<br/>
    Here the user need to guess 5 different perfect squares of length 4 given a prefix of length 3.<br/>

  * Third Round:<br/>
    Here the user need to guess 5 different perfect squares of length 5 given a prefix of length 4.<br/>
    Entering Solve button at any stage leads to display of the appropriate perfect square.<br/>
    
  *Before going to next round your score should be greater than 10 else you will have play for the same round.
 
  * And So on ...  , make Best your level. All the Best. :)<br/>
 
   We use Data structure Redix Tree :<br/>
     A radix tree is a compressed version of a trie.In a trie, on each edge you write a<br/> 
     single letter, while in a Patricia tree(or radix tree) we store whole words.<br/>
     It takes less memory compared to trie node.
